# Profanity Checking Discord Bot
This Discord Bot will check for profanity throughout the invited server. If detected, it will instantly delete the message and DM the owner of the message. The Discord Bot also accounts for variations in text and language to mimic profanity. For example, a55/a$$/@ss is registered as profanity. The Bad Word Filter API by Neutrino API was used to parse input and determine if they have any profanity.
